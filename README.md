A skill for Mycroft. Tell the temperature

## About
Tell the temperature outside the building in degrees celsius, including latest 24 hour highs and lows.
Since Mycroft has been discontinued this skill is probably not very useful. It might or might not work with OpenVoiceOS, but that has not been tested and will not be supported.

## Examples
* "How warm is it outside"
* "How cold is it outside"
* "How warm is it"
* "How cold is it"
* "What's the temperature"
* "What is the temperature"
